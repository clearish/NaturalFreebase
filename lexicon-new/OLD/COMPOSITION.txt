What would be wrong with using a truly compositional framework?
Use general function application and predicate modification.

book = Lx . book(x)
author = Lx Ly . author-of(x)(y)
by = Lx Ly . author-of(y)(x) & author(x) & book(y)
by = Lx Ly . director-of(y)(x) & director(x) & movie(y) 
Canadian = ...

Kind of a pain to deal even with of-PPs on this framework.
